# Simplified-4D-Cube
  
  This is an interactive visualisation of 4-dimensional cube.
  you are able to interact with the given visualisation of 4D-cube/ Quad (better name then teseract). 

### How the rotations work
 -I'll be using terms to lable each cubes:
    -Center cube - A cube that's look surrounded by six cubes in the visualisation, it will also be used an Origin.
    -Left and Right cubes - The cubes that are located at -ve X and +ve X respectively from the Center cube.
    -Front and Back cubes - The cubes that are located at -ve Z and +ve Z respectively from the Center cube.
    -Down and Up cubes - The cubes that are located at -ve Y and +ve Y respectively from the Center cube.
    -Outer cube - A cube that is rotated in w-axis to appear bigger than it should, and containing all other cubes.
 
## 4D X-Ring
 - This ring consists of four cubes Up, Down, Front and Back cubes.
 - They rotate 90deg towards the Outer cube.
 - The rotation of 4D xRing happens every time the Left or Right cube rotates in w-axis.


## 4D Y-Ring
 - This ring consists of four cubes Up, Down, Left and Right cubes.
 - They rotate 90deg towards the Outer cube.
 - The rotation of 4D xRing happens every time the front or back cube rotates in w-axis.

## 4D Z-Ring
 - This ring consists of four cubes Left, Right, Front and Back cubes.
 - They rotate 90deg towards the Outer cube.
 - The rotation of 4D xRing happens every time the Up or Down cube rotates in w-axis.

  ## All possible interactive roatations
   - X, Y and Z axis
   - 4D-xRing, 4D-yRing and 4D-zRing
   - 4D X, 4D Y and 4D Z
   - Inversion 4D 

  ## Solution to the scramble
  - white in center, black cover
  - red up , orange down
  - blue left , green right
  - white back , yellow front
   

   if you dont get it thats a joke you physically cannot scramble it
